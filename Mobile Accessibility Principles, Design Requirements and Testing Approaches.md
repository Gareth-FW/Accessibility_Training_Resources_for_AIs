# Mobile First UX Accessibility Principles, Design Requirements and Testing Approaches

---

## Foundational Principles

Accessible mobile applications and websites must be designed and developed using approaches that ensure compatibility, predictability, and inclusivity across different user needs and technologies.

### Use platform and web standards as intended  
Applications and websites must follow platform and web standards in their intended way. Deviating from standard implementation introduces risk, particularly for users who depend on platform-level accessibility features such as screen readers, magnification, or alternative input systems.

### Use standard interface controls where possible  
Standard interface controls inherently include accessibility semantics, behaviours, and compatibility with assistive technologies. Custom controls often fail to replicate these fully, which can result in reduced usability or complete inaccessibility.

### Support platform accessibility  
All functionality and content must work alongside native accessibility features rather than overriding or disabling them. Users may rely on multiple accessibility features simultaneously, and systems must support this flexibility.

### Support multiple modes of interaction  
Users must be able to interact with content using different input methods, including touch, keyboard, voice, and assistive technologies. No single method should be required to complete an action.

## Audio and Video

### Alternatives for audio and visual content (must)  
All audio and visual media must include alternative formats such as subtitles, transcripts, audio description, or equivalent representations. These alternatives ensure that users who cannot perceive one modality can still access the same information.

**Approach**  
Provide equivalent information across multiple modalities. Ensure synchronisation between media and its alternatives.

**Testing Procedure**  
- Identify media containing meaningful audio or visual information  
- Verify that audio content is supported by synchronised subtitles  
- Verify that visual content is described via audio or text  

**Outcome**  
- Subtitles or captions are present and synchronised  
- Visual information is described or otherwise accessible  

---

### Autoplay (must not)  
Audio must not play automatically unless users are clearly informed and provided with immediate controls to stop, pause, or mute playback.

**Approach**  
Ensure users initiate audio playback or are given explicit control and warning.

**Testing Procedure**  
- Identify screens where media loads  
- Verify whether audio plays automatically  
- Check for warning and control availability  

**Outcome**  
- Audio does not autoplay, or  
- Users are warned and can control playback immediately  

---

### Metadata (should)  
Media should include descriptive metadata such as duration, format, and availability of alternative versions.

**Approach**  
Provide clear descriptive information to support user decision-making and navigation.

**Testing Procedure**  
- Inspect media metadata  
- Verify presence of descriptive information  

**Outcome**  
- Metadata is present and accurate  

---

### Volume control (should)  
Users should be able to independently control different audio layers.

**Approach**  
Separate audio channels where possible to allow selective adjustment.

**Testing Procedure**  
- Identify media with multiple audio layers  
- Verify independent control  

**Outcome**  
- Users can adjust or mute different audio components  

---

### Audio conflict (should not)  
Media audio must not interfere with assistive technology output.

**Approach**  
Ensure that audio from media does not overlap or obscure assistive technology speech.

**Testing Procedure**  
- Enable assistive technology  
- Play media  
- Verify clarity of assistive output  

**Outcome**  
- Assistive technology remains clearly audible  

---

## Design Requirements

- Verify alternative indicators exist  

**Outcome**  
- Meaning is conveyed without reliance on colour alone  

---

### Styling and readability (must)  
Content must remain usable when styling is removed or unsupported.

## Implementation Recommendations

- Provide a core accessible experience as a baseline  
- Build functionality progressively  
- Ensure consistency across platforms

---

## Outcome-Based Validation

Accessibility is confirmed when:

- Users can complete tasks successfully  
- Content is understandable and usable  
- Interaction works across input methods  
- Assistive technologies function correctly  
- Users can adapt the experience to their needs  

These outcomes must be consistently achievable across different user capabilities and contexts.
